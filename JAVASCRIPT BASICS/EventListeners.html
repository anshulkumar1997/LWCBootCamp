    <h2>Custom Events</h2>

    <div>
      A custom event can be created using the CustomEvent constructor. This
      takes two arguments, the first is the name of the event and the second is
      an object that contains the data. After creating the events, you need to
      be able to dispatch them. To listen for the custom event, add an event
      listener to the element you want to listen on.
      <div>
        const myEvent = new CustomEvent("myevent", { detail: {}, bubbles: true,
        cancelable: true, composed: false});
        document.querySelector("#element").dispatchEvent(myEvent);
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
