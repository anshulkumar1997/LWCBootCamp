    <h1>Export and Import</h1>
    <div>
      The export and import are the keywords used for exporting and importing
      one or more members in a module.
    </div>
    <h2>Export</h2>
    <div>
      <ul>
        1.We can label any declaration as exported by placing export before it,
        be it a variable, function or a class.
      </ul>
      <ul>
        2.Also put export separately - first declare, and then export:
      </ul>
      <ul>
        3.Modules provide a special export default ("the default export")
        syntax. There may be only one export default per file.
      </ul>
      <h2>Import</h2>
    <div>
      <ul>
        1.Import needs curly braces for
        named exports and doesn't need
        them for the default one.
      </ul>
      <ul>
        2.A lot to import, we can import
        everything as an object using
        import * as <obj>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        3.We can also use as to import
        under different names.
      </ul>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
