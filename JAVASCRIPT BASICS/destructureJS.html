    Destructuring Assignment is a JavaScript expression that allows to
unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct
variables.

Data can be extracted from arrays, objects, nested objects and
assigning to variables. Destructuring makes it easy to extract only
what is needed.

When destructuring arrays, the order that variables are declared
is important.

Object properties do not have to be declared in a specific order.
