    Object values are written as name : value pairs (name and value
separated by a colon).

An object can be created with figure brackets { ... } with an optional
list of properties. A property is a "key: value" pair, where a key is a
string (also called a "property name"), and the value can be anything.

You can create a JavaScript object from a JSON object literal
JSON.parse(myJSON) and Object into String by JSON.Stringify(myObj)

You can access object values by using dot (.) notation and access
object values by using bracket ([]) notation

You can loop through object properties with a for-in loop
