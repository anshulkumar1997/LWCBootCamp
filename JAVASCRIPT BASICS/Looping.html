    if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a
different value.

JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:

for - loops through a block of code a number of times
for/in - loops through the properties of an object
for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
while - loops block of code while a specified condition is true
do/while - also loops block of code while a specified condition is true

The break statement "jumps out" of a loop.
The continue statement "jumps over" one iteration in the loop.
