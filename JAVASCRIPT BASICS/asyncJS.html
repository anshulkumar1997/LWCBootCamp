    <h1>Async JS</h1>
    <script src="async.js"></script>
    <div>
      <p>
        The asynchronous style of programming focuses more on improving the
        performance of the application and callbacks can also be used in such
        situations.
      </p>
      X Callback Hell > The phenomenon which happens when we nest multiple
      callbacks within a function is called a callback hell. It makes the code
      very difficult to understand and maintain
      <div>
        Ex - getArticles(20, (user) => { console.log("Fetch articles", user);
        getUserData(user.username, (name) => { console.log(name);
        getAddress(name, (item) => { console.log(item); // this goes on and on
        }...)})})
      </div>
      <div>Two ways to escape the callback hell in JavaScript</div>
      <ul>
        Promises
      </ul>
      <div>
        <ul>
          A promise is basically a promise to return something at a later time.
          Either the thing you wanted is returned, or an error.
        </ul>
        <ul>
          Promise are usually used for callouts to get data or do an operation
          on data (CRUD, etc). All Apex Methods returns Promise
        </ul>
        <ul>
          The Promise object supports two properties: state and result.
        </ul>
        <ul>
          Promises take a callback function as their only parameter which takes
          two parameters that must be functions. The two functions that are
          taken as parameters will be executed based on whether the promise has
          been fufilled or rejected.
        </ul>
        <ul>
          We then need to do something with the promise when it's resolved or
          rejected which is done using the then() function and making sure we
          catch if the promise is rejected.
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>State --- Result</div>
      <div>"pending" --- undefined</div>
      <div>"fulfilled" --- a result value</div>
      <div>"rejected" --- an error object</div>
      <div>
        <div>
          var p = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) { if
          (successfulCperation) { resolve(someData); } else { reject(Error('some
          error message')); }})
        </div>
        <div>
          p.then(function (data) { // do something with the data
          }).catch(function (err) { // handle any errors})
        </div>
        getArticles(10) then((user) => getUserName(user.name)) .then((place) =>
        getAddress(place.city)) .then((data) => console.log("Data", data))
        .catch((err) => console.log("Error: ", err.message));
      </div>
      <ul>
        Async/Await
      </ul>
      <div>
        <ul>
          The latest release introduced async functions and a different way of
          calling native promises. The structure of the promise remains the
          same, but what changes is how the promise is called
        </ul>
        <ul>
          Async/await is essentially a way to write asynchronous code that looks
          and behaves more like synchronous code.
        </ul>
        <ul>
          The async keyword is used to define an asynchronous function, which
          returns a promise. Within this function, you can use the await keyword
          to pause the execution of the function until a promise is resolved or
          rejected.
        </ul>
        <ul>
          If an exception is thrown in an async function, the promise it returns
          will be rejected with that exception. This can be handled by catching
          errors with try/catch blocks as usual:
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        async function showImages() { try { const article = await
        getArticle(10); const place = await getUserData(user.name); const city =
        await getAddress(place) console.log(city); } catch (err) {
        console.log("Error: ", err.message); }}
      </div>
      <h2>Promise.all</h2>
      <ul>
        It is a built-in helper that accepts an array of promises (or generally
        an iterable).
      </ul>
      <ul>
        If all promises are resolved successfully, then allPromise fulfills with
        an array containing fulfilled values of the promises. The order of
        promises in the array does matter - you'll get the fulfilled values in
        the same order.
      </ul>
      <ul>
        But if at least one promise rejects, then allPromise rejects right away
        (without waiting for the remaining pending promises to resolve) for the
        same reason.
      </ul>
      <div>
        ex - const allPromise = Promise.all([promise1, promise2]);
        allPromise.then(values => { console.log(values); // [resolvedValue1,
        resolvedValue2] }).catch(error => { console.log(error); // rejectReason
        of any first rejected promise });
      </div>
      <div>
        const allPromise = Promise. all([promise1, promise2]); try { const
        values = await allPromise; console.log(values); // [resolvedValue1,
        resolvedValue2] } catch (error) { console.log(error); // rejectReason of
        any first reject }
      </div>
      <h2>Promise.any</h2>
      <div>
        <ul>
          The function accepts an array (or generally an iterable) of promises
          as an argument
        </ul>
        <ul>
          The promise returned by Promise.any() fulfills with any first
          fulfilled promise. Even if some promises get rejected, these
          rejections
        </ul>
        are ignored.
        <ul>
          However, if all promises in the input array are rejected or if the
          input array is empty, then Promise.any() rejects with an aggregate
          error containing all the rejection reasons of the input promises.
        </ul>
        <div>
          const anyPromise = Promise.any(promises); anyPromise. then(firstValue
          => { firstValue; // The value of the first fulfilled promise }); const
          firstValue = await anyPromise; firstValue; // The value of the first
          fulfilled promise
        </div>
      </div>
      <h2>Promise.race</h2>
      <ul>
        The function accepts an array (or generally an iterable) of promises as
        an argument
      </ul>
      <ul>
        The name of Promise.race() implies that all the promises race against
        each other with a single winner, either resolved or rejected.
      </ul>
      <ul>
        However, if all promises in the input array are rejected or if the input
        array is empty, then Promise.any() rejects with an aggregate error
        containing all the rejection reasons of the input promises.
      </ul>
      <div>
        Promise.race([p1, p2]) .then(value => console. log('Resolved: ${value}')
        ) .catch(reason => console.log('Rejected: ${reason}'));
      </div>
    </div>
